Renders a Mandlebrot set using Javascript and the <canvas> object. Does not need external libraries. Also visualizes Julia sets at arbitrary points in the Mandlebrot.

Features:

* Iteration control.
* X/Y axis display.
* Continuous smooth coloring.
* Linear coloring (color mapped).
* Reads Julia set coordinates via GET parameters.

Optimizations (Mandlebrot only):
* Cardiod test.
* Bulb test.
